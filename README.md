## Project Description

### Goal:

The "E-Commerce Dashboard" project aims to provide businesses with a tool for monitoring orders and sales in their online stores. The dashboard allows real-time tracking of key sales metrics and analysis of results, enabling effective business decision-making and optimization of sales processes.

### Features Description:

- **Order Monitoring:** Users can view the order history, fulfillment status, and key transaction details.
- **Sales Analysis:** Tracks sales metrics such as revenue, order count, average cart value, and more.
- **View Customization:** Allows users to personalize their dashboard by choosing specific metrics and arranging chart layouts.
- **Report Generation:** Automatic reporting of sales performance, with statistics available for selected periods and data export options.
- **Notifications and Alerts:** Configurable alerts for specific events, such as low stock levels, order cancellations, or reaching a certain sales threshold.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Order Monitoring:** Users can view order details, including order date, products, payment status, and shipping status.
- **Sales Metrics Analysis:** Access to sales statistics, with options to compare results across different time periods.
- **Dashboard Customization:** Allows customization of the dashboard layout and the selection of displayed metrics.
- **Sales Report Generation:** Enables report generation and export to formats like PDF or CSV.
- **Notifications and Alerts:** Users can set alerts and receive notifications via email or SMS for specific events.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **User Interface:** Intuitive and visually appealing UI/UX, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Scalability:** The system should support a high volume of orders and scale with increasing user demand.
- **Security:** Protects sales data and customer information using security protocols.
- **Speed:** Fast loading of the interface and real-time data access with minimal wait times.

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores order, sales, and analytics data, including:

- **Order Data:** Information on order dates, products, fulfillment status, prices, and customer information.
- **Analytics Data:** Metrics such as revenue, order count, average cart value, and conversion rates.
- **Notifications:** Data on user-configured alerts and their status.

### Architecture Diagram:

The architecture is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure:

- **Model:** Manages order data, sales metrics, and notifications.
- **View:** Presents the user interface and graphical representation of data.
- **Controller:** Manages interactions between the model and view, processes user requests, and provides data.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js) for building the user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) as the backend server, handling user requests and database communication.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing order data, sales metrics, and notification settings.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Code structure with separate folders for frontend, backend, database configuration, and notification management.
- _Coding Style:_ Modularity, readability, comments, and best practices for code structure.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Verifying the accuracy of order monitoring, sales analysis, and notification functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensuring components work together correctly, such as syncing order data between view and model.
- **User Interface Testing:** Checking responsiveness and interaction on various devices.
- **Performance Testing:** Assessing data loading speed and response times.

### Testing Procedures:

- Development of test cases for each function in the application.
- Documentation of test results and procedures for fixing identified issues.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Phases:** Functional testing, bug fixes, and publication on the production platform.
- **Timelines:** Schedule of planned phases and their dates.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Communication channels for users to report technical issues.
- **Updates:** Regular updates based on user needs and feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Stages of Development:** Implementation of order monitoring, sales analysis, report generation, testing.
- **Deadlines:** Estimated time for each phase.

## Budget Estimate:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Developer hours or team cost.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Server hosting, external service fees, and technical support.
